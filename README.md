##  TO DO (refactoring and encapsulation)
* Replace strings additions by multiline strings 

 ```javascript       
let myNumber = 1;
let str = `this a  multine string,
           myNumber value is ${myNumber}`;
 ```
        
* design a simpler layout for option presentation
* Refactor quest.js
* Encapsulate Gui
* Remove what is hardcoded as much as possible (create an experiment parameters config file?)
